# Find the Lexicographically Smallest Valid Sequence

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`.

A string `x` is called  **almost equal**  to `y` if you can change  **at most**  one character in `x` to make it  *identical*  to `y`.

A sequence of indices `seq` is called  **valid**  if:

- The indices are sorted in ascending order.
- Concatenating the characters at these indices in word1 in the same order results in a string that is almost equal to word2.

Return an array of size `word2.length` representing the lexicographically smallest  **valid**  sequence of indices. If no such sequence of indices exists, return an  **empty**  array.

 **Note**  that the answer must represent the  *lexicographically smallest array*,  **not**  the corresponding string formed by those indices.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  word1 = "vbcca", word2 = "abc"

 **Output:**  [0,1,2]

 **Explanation:** 

The lexicographically smallest valid sequence of indices is `[0, 1, 2]`:

- Change word1[0] to 'a'.
- word1[1] is already 'b'.
- word1[2] is already 'c'.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  word1 = "bacdc", word2 = "abc"

 **Output:**  [1,2,4]

 **Explanation:** 

The lexicographically smallest valid sequence of indices is `[1, 2, 4]`:

- word1[1] is already 'a'.
- Change word1[2] to 'b'.
- word1[4] is already 'c'.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  word1 = "aaaaaa", word2 = "aaabc"

 **Output:**  []

 **Explanation:** 

There is no valid sequence of indices.

 **Example 4:** 

 **Input:**  word1 = "abc", word2 = "ab"

 **Output:**  [0,1]

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= word2.length < word1.length <= 3 * 105
- word1 and word2 consist only of lowercase English letters.

        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();

        int[] last = new int[m];

        java.util.Arrays.fill(last, -1);

        int i = n - 1;
        int j = m - 1;

        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(j)) {
                last[j] = i;
                --j;
            }

            --i;
        }

        int[] ans = new int[m];
        int size = 0;

        boolean canSkip = true;
        j = 0;

        for (i = 0; i < n && j < m; ++i) {
            if (word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(j)) {
                ans[size++] = i;

            }
            else if (canSkip &&
                     (j == m - 1 || i < last[j + 1])) {
                canSkip = false;
                ans[size++] = i;
                ++j;
            }
        }

        if (j == m) {
            return ans;
        }

        return new int[0];
    }
